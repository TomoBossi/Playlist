        I began building this playlist from nothingness years ago. 2017, maybe. Since then, this has
        become to me a sort of personal zen garden. I've seen this playlist grow slowly and organically over the years.
        Whenever I carefully choose where to plant a song or an album based on sound or theme or visuals or unlikely coincidences, 
        or whenever I make a semi-calculated rearrangement to an existing collection of sounds, I really
        do feel like a gardener full of fatherly care doing loving maintenance work for his ever sprouting greens and reds and purples. 
        To my permanent surprise, this playlist has become large enough that it sometimes feels like an entity with
        a sort of life of its own, again like a thriving garden turned ecosystem that makes half the decisions as to
        where or why seemingly by itself. I find it in many ways a reflection of my self, too; oddly one that I'm somewhat proud of.

        This website, sadly, uses Youtube's iframe API to play music. Otherwise, it was built from scratch using
        plain HTML, CSS, and again, sadly, JS. It is unusable without a proper ad-blocker.
        If we ever lose the ad-blocking battle to Google (very unlikely), I'll make sure to disable all functionality related to the API.
        At that point the site would become a mere frontend for my playlist's metadata backup, but that might
        honestly be good enough.

        This is my (only) personal playlist. Why is it online? I'll get to that later. Why here? I've never liked Spotify much.
        Not because of how unfair it may or may not be to small musicians, rather because of my own end-user
        experience. A lot of amazing music doesn't make it to Spotify, or if it does it's often region-locked.
        Reasons for this vary. Generally speaking you are extremely likely to find a song if it's popular enough.
        This makes Spotify a great platform for the average user, but it can be depressing for those with an interest
        in the slightly "lesser-known" who care deeply about keeping all of their beloved music in one place. Most
        of the music on this playlist is popular enough to exist on Spotify, but a lot of it isn't. Getting online access
        to the whole of it was one of my main motivators in leaving Spotify.

        This website uses Youtube's Iframe API. Youtube is, also, absolute trash.
        At the time of writing this, and surely at the time of reading this as well, Google is one of the worlds
        largest public enemies. The worst kind of enemy at that, one that pretends to be a friend. Google is
        so powerful and so huge that it has become part of what we may in very abstract terms call "the system".
        If you were to suddenly demolish Google and all it's services, the net loss for humanity, global economy,
        and even culture would be incalculably high. Google's malignant tendrils of rot pierce the rest of 
        "the system" in so many ways and from so many angles that, like a metastatic cancer on an already broken host,
        it has become part of it. In other words, Google is so powerful, evil and opressive that you could make
        the informed arguement that even doing something as seemingly inocuous as using its services for personal
        purposes is profoundly unethical. Yet, I'm using Youtube's API. Sadly, it works really well.
        I'd rather host all of the music files on this page's GitHub repo and learn how to make an audio
        player from scratch to play .flac or hq .mp3 files, but GitHub would delete it all as soon as I'd do my
        first push because of the sheer amount of space I'd require. Since we're at it, Microsoft is also terrible.
        Yet, I'm also using GitHub. For now, though, this is as far as I'm willing to go when it comes to avoiding
        these evils. Hopefully, I'll soon have enough resources to start self-hosting everything I make for the web.

        Despite not being built for the purposes of listening to music, and despite the fact that it absolutely cannot
        be trusted, Youtube is still all in all a much better vault for humanity's music than Spotify could ever hope
        to be; this is largely due to users having lots of freedom when it comes to uploading "lesser-known" music,
        which is often not even copyrighted. Why not a Youtube playlist, then? Simply because I'd rather not tie this
        playlist to a particular Google account. Why not create and host this playlist on a privacy-focused Youtube
        frontend? I'm not too confident on the long term survivability of these sites and their users' data.
        Besides, building this website has been a great excuse for me to learn some long-needed HTML and CSS. Apart from
        the Iframe API, this website was built from scratch using plain Javascript, HTML and CSS with basically no prior experience
        working with the latter two. But why even host my playlist instead of just keeping a local copy for myself?
        It comes down to the fact that I feel very much in love with the idea of sharing this playlist with the
        vastness of the Internet in a playable format. The reason being that this is for me, essentially, an
        art project.
